SQL Certification Preparation

Welcome, everyone!

As I embark on the journey towards becoming a certified Associate SQL Analyst, I find it essential to share my preparation process with fellow learners. Currently, I'm gearing up by undertaking practice tests that closely resemble the certification exams.
Test Overview

In total, there are four tests in this preparation phase:

    Test 1: Focuses on fundamental SQL queries and theoretical concepts.
    Test 2: Similar to Test 1, emphasizing SQL queries and theory.
    Test 3: Round 3 are on the graphs and visualization.
    Test 4: The most challenging of them all, Statistical theory which is really a tough one.

And I uploaded a test number 4.

Purpose

The primary objective of this endeavor is to not only prepare myself but also to provide a resource for others navigating the same path. I believe collective learning and sharing benefit everyone involved.

Feel free to explore the materials provided here and utilize them in your preparation journey. Let's strive for excellence together!
